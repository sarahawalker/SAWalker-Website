bio: Broadly, my research interests are focused within personality, and
  cognitive abilities. More specifically, research has focused on the dark triad
  of personality, response bias (socially desirable responding) in the context
  of self- and informant-reporting. My current research is focused on extrinsic
  emotion regulation and how people make others feel better and/or worse across
  different contexts and relationships, what motivates extrinsic emotion
  regulation, and the long term impact on relationship satisfaction and personal
  wellbeing.
