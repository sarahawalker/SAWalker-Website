abstract: The study of emotional intelligence (EI) and its relationship with the
  dark triad has emerged as a popular research area. However, the complex nature
  of the dark triad and EI, including multiple measures for assessment, has led
  to inconsistent findings. A systematic review was conducted to focus on the
  multifaceted nature of the dark triad traits. Included studies must have been
  conducted with adult samples using standardized EI and dark triad measures.
  Forty-eight studies were identified; all bar one reported overall negative
  associations between the dark triad and EI. These associations were more
  complicated than expected. Further examination found these relationships
  significantly differed when examined at the facet level. Our results highlight
  that future research requires more than a one-size-fits-all approach.
